# IMDB-Movie-Review-Analyser

It is a Movie Review Analyser based on Machine Learning. <br> 
It tells us if a movie is good to watch or not. <br>
Our ML model is based on both Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. <br>
We also used violinplot with the help of Seaborn library to display the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared.

The dataset used in this project will be available on Kaggle <br>
